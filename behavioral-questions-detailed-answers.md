## Leadership

### 1. Describe a situation where you had to make a tough decision that impacted your team. How did you manage the change and communicate it?

**Company:** Meta
**Difficulty:** Hard

**Sample STAR Answer:**

**Situation:** In my previous role as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fast-growing startup, our team was tasked with delivering a critical feature for our largest client within a tight 6-week deadline. However, halfway through the project, we discovered that the initial technical approach would not scale to handle the client's data volume requirements.

**Task:** I needed to lead the team through a significant technical pivot while maintaining the original deadline and ensuring team morale remained high during this challenging period.

**Action:** I immediately called a team meeting to transparently discuss the situation. I worked with the team to evaluate three alternative approaches, facilitating technical discussions and helping the team reach consensus on the best path forward. I then negotiated with stakeholders to adjust the scope slightly while maintaining the core functionality. I also implemented daily check-ins to monitor progress and provide support where needed.

**Result:** We successfully delivered the feature on time with the new architecture that could handle 10x the original data volume. The client was extremely satisfied, and the team felt proud of overcoming the technical challenge. This experience also led to improved technical planning processes for future projects.

**Key Takeaways:**
- STAR-focused

### 9. Describe a time when you led a team through a challenging project.

**Company:** Meta
**Difficulty:** Medium

**Sample STAR Answer:**

**Situation:** In my previous role as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fast-growing startup, our team was tasked with delivering a critical feature for our largest client within a tight 6-week deadline. However, halfway through the project, we discovered that the initial technical approach would not scale to handle the client's data volume requirements.

**Task:** I needed to lead the team through a significant technical pivot while maintaining the original deadline and ensuring team morale remained high during this challenging period.

**Action:** I immediately called a team meeting to transparently discuss the situation. I worked with the team to evaluate three alternative approaches, facilitating technical discussions and helping the team reach consensus on the best path forward. I then negotiated with stakeholders to adjust the scope slightly while maintaining the core functionality. I also implemented daily check-ins to monitor progress and provide support where needed.

**Result:** We successfully delivered the feature on time with the new architecture that could handle 10x the original data volume. The client was extremely satisfied, and the team felt proud of overcoming the technical challenge. This experience also led to improved technical planning processes for future projects.
