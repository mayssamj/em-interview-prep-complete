1. **Technical Debt Audit**: I led the team in cataloging and prioritizing technical debt based on impact and effort.
2. **Business Case**: I created a presentation for leadership showing how technical debt was affecting velocity and customer experience.
3. **20% Rule**: I negotiated with product management to allocate 20% of each sprint to technical debt reduction.
4. **Integration Strategy**: We identified opportunities to address technical debt while implementing new features.
5. **Metrics Tracking**: I established metrics to track technical debt reduction and its impact on velocity.

**Result**: Over 6 months, we reduced critical technical debt by 60%, improved deployment frequency from weekly to daily, and increased development velocity by 35%. The business saw faster feature delivery and improved system reliability.

## Cross-functional Collaboration

### Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to work with product management to deliver a complex project."

**Sample Answer:**
**Situation**: Product management wanted to launch a new recommendation engine within 3 months for the holiday season, but initial technical estimates suggested it would take 6 months.

**Task**: I needed to find a way to deliver value within the business timeline while maintaining technical quality.

**Action**:
1. **Requirements Deep Dive**: I worked closely with the PM to understand the core business value and identify must-have vs. nice-to-have features.
2. **Phased Approach**: I proposed a 3-phase delivery plan: MVP in 3 months, enhanced features in month 4-5, and advanced features in month 6.
3. **Technical Innovation**: I identified an existing ML library that could accelerate development and proposed A/B testing to validate the approach.
4. **Regular Sync**: I established weekly sync meetings with PM, design, and data science teams to ensure alignment.
5. **Risk Management**: I created contingency plans for potential technical challenges.

**Result**: We delivered the MVP recommendation engine in 2.5 months, which increased user engagement by 25% during the holiday season. The phased approach allowed us to gather user feedback and improve the algorithm, resulting in a 40% improvement in recommendation accuracy by the final phase.

## Project & Process Management

### Question: "Tell me about a time when a project was falling behind schedule. How did you handle it?"

**Sample Answer:**
